        <h3 id="commh3"> Content within the Webpage </h3>
            <span> The website is made up of 4 HTML files, 1 CSS file and numerous PNG files. This structure is best represented in the table below:  </span>

            <img class="structure-png" src= "structure.png" alt="Visual Representation of header, main and footer classes">
            <h3 id="commh3"> Structure of the Webpage </h3>
                <span> A HTML file contains the root elements of the webpage, which a user will be able to see once they have loaded it up on their browser. The file will provide appropriate meta-information to the browser (such as the utilized stylesheet), found in the <span id="code"> < head ></span> element. </span> 
                <br> <br> 
            <p> The structure of a website is mainly built upon a container elements known as a <span id="code"> < div ></span>. This allows for programmers to group content appropriate into sections and build upon a specific layout by using classes and id's. Within my website, I have seperated the content of the webpage by using 3 different div classes:  </p> 
            <span id="source"> Image sourced from <a href="https://codingislove.com/pan-cake-stack-layout-grid-css/"> CodingLove </a> </span>
            <ul>
                <li> Header </li>
                <li> Main </li>
                <li> Footer </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div> 
            <h3 id="commh3"> Components of the Webpage </h3>
                <p id="header-comment"> 1. Header</p>
                <img class="code-png" src= "code3.png" alt="Code of structure-png">
                <p> The header div is an essential aspect of the webpage as it is the first content that will be loaded onto a user's browser. Firstly, the header contains the title of the webpage "Alex-Bytes Bytes | Web Systems Assignment" within a h1 tag. This tags define the heading of the webpage (which is usually the largest text), which do appear within search engines such as Google.   </p>
                <p> Furthermore, the header also include the webpage's navigation bar for user's to access the other webpages (other HTML files). This is achieved by creating an unordered list consisting 4 columns  named "Index", "Comment", "Past", "Future". After this, I utilized the display CSS property in order to change the navigation cells into singular block's (display: block; ). Finally, for user's to know which webpage they were currently on a separate id called "active" was placed within the appropriate block cell which would change the background color.        </p>
            <p id="main-comment"> 2. Main</p>
                <p> The main div contains the majority of the content in the webpage <span class="personal-list"> (such as the text you are reading right now!). </span> Within the main class, titles are divided into < h2 > tags, as this sets the according size. Furthermore, text is assigned to paragraph tags < p >, as well as span tags < span > which groups inline elements. Additionally, the images are also found within the main class using the image < img > tag as it direct's png files found within the directory onto the webpage.</a> </p>
                <img class="code-png" src= "code.png" alt="Code of structure-png">
                <p> To control the visual's of the main class, id's and classes are utilized for each tag. Using CSS, changes to the positioning of the content can easily be adjusted on the fly. For example; the image in the "Structure of the Webpage" section contains the class "structure-png", which correctly define the position using the float and padding elements. To account for the read-ability of the webpage, the resolution are defined within the class using height/width elements as this ensures the image can be viewed by all user's on any display.         </p> 
                <p id="footer-comment"> 3. Footer</p> 
                <img class="code-png" src= "code2.png" alt="Code of footer-png">
                <p> The footer div is the last section of every HTML file and contains useful information about the author of the website. Within the footer, paragraph elements < p > are used to detail the authors name, the subject name and the university that they attend. Additionally, the CSS class "footer" utilises the "background" element to differentiate the footer section from the main section. The text in the footer is also enclosed using paragraph tags < p > and are shifted to the left using the "text-align" element.   </p>
        </div>
        
        <br> <br> 
        <div> 
            <h3 id="commh3"> Aesthetics of Webpage </h3>
                <p> The main goal of my website is to ensure information is easily accessible and user-friendly. To achieve this, I have aimed to ensure that the aesthetics of my website are calming and simplistic, as this fosters a seamless and engaging experience for all user's.      </p>
                <img class="color-png" src= "color-pallet.png" alt="Visual Color Pallet">
            <h4 id="test123"> Color </h4>
                <p> The color choice is an integral aspect of my website, as it dictates the usability and readability of text. The colors follow the <span id="code"> "Pretty Blues and Greens Color Palette" </span> color scheme due to its aesthetically pleasing nature and ability to evoke a sense of calmness. Additionally, the color scheme meets my previously stated goal of visibility and readability due to its ability to contrast the text and background effectively. 
                 As such, colors have been integrated to differentiate elements of the webpage, such as the h1 tags and the paragraph tags. This ultimately allows for certain elements to be reinforced to visitors by complementing color choices with CSS text properties such as bolding, underlining and italics.   </p>
                 <span id="source"> Image sourced from <a href="https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/47206"> Color-Hex </a> </span>
            <br> 
            <h4 id="test123"> Font </h4>
                <p> The font used throughout the website has been chosen to ensure text is visible and readable in all context. Sans-serif is a widely recognized font due to his consistency to render across all devices and browsers. This font is commonly used only as the lettering is clean and simple, ensuring that each character is easily distinguishable from one another. However, if this font is unable to be rendered on a user's device, a supplementary font known as "Times New Roman" will utilised on the webpage. This ultimately ensures a seamless reading experience for all visitors, regardless of their device or browser, and maintains the website's commitment to accessibility and readability    </p>
                <p> Font styling is another important aspect for the webpage as it allows for text to be differentiated and highlighted. Within my CSS file, I have utilized the font-style element in order to differentiate heading, bold text for important information and underline sub-headings.   </p>    
            <br> 
            <h4 id="test123"> Structure </h4>
                <p> My webpage is designed with a linear structure, ensuring that information unfolds seamlessly as users scroll down the page. It features a clean and distinctive navigation system, presenting easily readable topics organized from left to right. This user-friendly layout is optimized for all devices, including desktops, laptops, and mobile devices, making efficient use of the available screen real estate. </p>
            <br> 
            <h3 id="commh3"> Accessibility </h3>
                <h4> Font Sizing </h4>
                    <img class="code-png" src= "code5.png" alt="Visual Demonstration of Zoom function">
                    <p> Font sizing for the webpage follows the "main" class which keeps all sizing consistent for every users screen. The main class has specified the font sizing to maintain a value of 170% of its parent element's font size using the CSS property "font-size." Utilizing this approach ensures that all text elements adapt to the context of the parental element, thus ensuring the design of the website is more responsive and adaptable to different screen resolutions. Additionally, relative font sizing improves accessibility as it allows users to adjust text (zoom) sizing on their browser. With some visitors having visual impairments and requiring larger text sizing, using percentages allows them to scale up text without breaking the structure of the website.   </p>
                    <img class="iphone-png" src= "code7.png" alt="iPhone user">
                <h4> Color Contrast </h4>
                    <p> The contrast between text and background color has been tested to ensure visibility and readability. As outlined within the above section " Aesthetics of Webpage", the webpage follows the "Pretty Blues and Greens Color Palette" due to it's ability to reduce eye-strain by using calm/cool colors for headers and text. Furthermore, the background color has been defined globally to ensure no rapid or unexpected changes when moving from webpage to webpage. The website has also undergone successful testing for colorblind viewers by using the <a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter"> Colorblind WebPage Filter </a>, which tests against Protanopia, Deuteranopla, Tritanopla and Achromastopsia. This meticulous attention to color choices and accessibility aims to provide an inclusive and user-friendly browsing experience for all visitors   </p>
                <br> <br> 
                <h4> Maintaining Web Structure </h4> 
                    
                    <p> To ensure the webpage looks and functions properly, the standard HTML tags have been used such as h1, p, ul. Utilizing standard tags retains the structure of the webpage regardless of whether the CSS file is linked properly to the HTML files. This is benefical to readers with poor internet connect and visitors who use the "Screen reader" mode. </p>
                    <img class="code-png" src= "code6.png" alt="iPhone user">
                    <p> Additionally, alternative tags < img alt >  have been implemented within the image tags using in order to provide some sort of feedback to users if the images do not load correctly. This ensures that the content remains accessible and informative, even in cases where visual elements may not be displayed as intended."  </p>
