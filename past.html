        <h2 id="past123"> Personal Experiences </h2>
        <p> I've been using a computer most of my life, with my earliest experiences on Windows XP with my father.   </p>
        <p> Throughout my life, my most memorable computing experiences include:  </p>
        <ul class="personal-list">
            <li> Repairing old iPhone and Android devices. </li>
            <li> Building desktop pc's for personal use. </li>
            <li> Setting up and configuring local NAS services. (Docker, Synology) </li>
            <li> Configuring and maintaining video-game servers. (Assetto Corsa, Counter-Strike, Minecraft) </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="past123"> School Experience </h2>
        <div> 
            <p> During my primary schooling, I was actively involved in the school's photography and advertisement scene. During my role, I maintained an active directory of the student achievements and schooling events that were directly uploaded to a website for all parent's to view. This experience was quite difficult as the school's computers were quite slow (2000's PC) and often disconnected from the internet.  </p>
        </div>  
        <div> 
            <p> Later on during high school, I studied Information Processes and Technology (IPT) during year 9 and 10. This subject mainly focused on Software Systems and Social/Ethical issues within a computing space.</p>
            <p> One of the most enjoyable assignments from this course was creating a scratch game.    </p>

            <br>  
            <p> I decided not to pursue another IT subject during my HSC as my school did not offer any courses. However, my past computing experiences helped me in:   </p>
            
            <ul class="personal-list">
                <li> Mathematic Advanced - Graphing Equations. </li>
                <li> English Standard - Multimodal presentation. </li>
                <li> Business Studies - Business Case Study video's. </li>
                <li> Physics - Visual Simulation of Drag </li>
                <li> Investigating Science - Real-time Simulation of Natural Selection </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="past123"> Past Work Experience </h2>
        <p> After I finished HSC, I worked as a support technician for my high school's IT department. I was tasked with assisting new students register their devices onto the school's system and connect to the WIFI. Additionally, I offered technical support for students and teachers in assisting them with responding to issues relating to hardware, software and network connectivity. Finally, I worked alongside experienced technical agents that diagnosed and resolved various IT problems within the school. During this experience, I obtained first hand experience with understanding large-scale networking infrastructure and security approaches to safely support thousands of devices. This ultimately advanced my interest within the networking and cybersecurity field.    </p>
