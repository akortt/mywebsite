            <p> I am aspiring to become a Cybersecurity consultant in the future as I am genuinely passionate about the networking and defense field. With cybersecurity threats and attacks occurring every day, I believe it is integral that security measures are taken accordingly in order to protect sensitive information from being accessed and distributed. My drive to problem-solve issue’s will benefit me as it is an integral aspect of this career goal in identifying vulnerability and developing viable solutions against cyber-attacks.  </p>
            <p> Learning about this area has been streamlined by Youtubers such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck">NetworkChuck</a> as he provides tutorials, guides, and insights into the current demand for networking, cybersecurity, and IT certifications. His content also covers current exploits and security issues present in major businesses around the world, encouraging for more active development of security. His content has heavily encouraged me to obtain my own certification when I better grasp networking fundamentals, such as Cisco's CCNA and CCNP certification’s.   </p>
